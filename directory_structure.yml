# DIRECTORY STRUCTURE TEMPLATE FOR NEW SOURCES
# =============================================================================
# create_source_folders() reads this file and generates the directory tree
# for a newly registered source. All paths may include "{source_id}" as a
# placeholder, which the function replaces at runtime.
#
# The generated folders support:
#   • Raw zone ingestion + archiving
#   • Staging zone processing
#   • Validated zone storage
#   • Governance logs + QC outputs
#
# NOTE:
#   The base path is assumed to be project root (".").
